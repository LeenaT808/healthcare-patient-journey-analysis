# Healthcare Patient Journey Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital patient journey data to understand cost drivers, readmission patterns, department efficiency, and patient satisfaction trends using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze patient distribution across departments  
- Identify key factors influencing hospital cost  
- Study readmission risk patterns  
- Examine the impact of complications on cost and satisfaction  
- Evaluate department-level wait time differences  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Renamed inconsistent column names  
- Converted cost and numeric columns to proper data types  
- Checked and handled missing values  
- Verified categorical variables for consistency  
- Prepared dataset for analysis and visualization  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Length of stay** and **number of procedures** are major drivers of total hospital cost  
- Patients with **chronic conditions** show higher 30-day readmission probability  
- **Complications** significantly increase cost and length of stay  
- Certain departments have higher average wait times  
- Patient satisfaction decreases in cases involving complications
